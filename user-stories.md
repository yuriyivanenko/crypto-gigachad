App Concept: Research crypto currencies

Feature 1: Fetch top 100 crypto currencies
 User Story: As a user upon loading the app I should see a list of all the crypto's and basic info for each
 one like market cap, price, change in the last 24hrs.
 Details: Fetch data and display all data in easy to read cards. Show: icon, name, price, change in last 24hrs.

Feature 2: Save favorite cryptos to database.
User Story: I should be able to click on a button like a Star and save that crypto to my backend. Then I should be able to view all my favorites separately from all the other cryptos.
Details: When someone clicks the 'Star' icon, save that crypto to the db.json file. Figure out how to display favorites separately from the main list.
